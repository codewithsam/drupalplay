# drupalplay
Axelerant page created in drupal from scratch by creating custom sub theme extending from classey base theme

#INTRO

The page are fully customizable from the admin panel. It is fully responsive and works on all devices. I created my custom theme from scratch by extending the classy base theme. I then created custom regions and then placed views and blocks in it. I have used the new block types feature of drupal 8, views and blocks. All the content and design was created using core druapal features without the use of plugins and customized by creating new twig files for necessary views/blocks and writing css for it.
